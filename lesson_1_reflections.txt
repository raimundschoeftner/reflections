How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
xxx xxx xxx

diff shows the differences between two text-files (versions of code)
	• non differing lines are not shown
	• the minus indicates lines that existed in the older version but are no longer there while
	• the plus sign indicates lines that were added in the newer version

the bug was easy to find because it was misspelled word in the newer version (wass't misspelled in the older one)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	• I can always take a step back to the last working version, if things don't work out ...
	• I can review (old) code to see what concepts I had in mind at the beginning of a project and compare it with the later version
	• int the long run there may develop some sort of pattern of frequently reappearing similar bugs/typoes and howto find/solve them

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
xxx xxx xxx
	
	Pro
	• possibility to commit only sane versions ... always have a "stable" version
	• keeping the development history clean and understandable by commiting after each "logical" change

	Contra
	• possibility to loose work (due to coffee-accidents, power-failure etc.)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
xxx xxx xxx
	• usually there are multiple files that are interconnected in applications, so it's often necessary to change (and save some) of them to implement features/changes 
	• Google docs on the other hand is not intendes for code-developers but to hold ones documents (texts, spreadsheets etc.)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
xx xxx xxx
	• use "git log [Filename]" to see commit history (log) 
	• compare commits with "git diff [commit id1] [commit id2]" to compare two commits and review changes...

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
xxx xxx xxx
	• If something breaks, I can always easily revert to (earlier) reasonably working versions by checking them out...
